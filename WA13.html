      <h3><b>Doge Coin to the Moon</b></h3>
      
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>DogeCoin has become more increasingly popular over the past year. Doge started off as a meme coin that people made as a joke. Due to many different factors like Elon Musk tweeting and an increase to Zoomers being interested in investing has caused DogeCoin to do some very interesting things. The main argument that I want to make throughout this Essay is that Zoomers are the reason DogeCoin has increased so much over the past year. The three topics I am going to highlight are Zoomers increased interest in Stock, Zoomers increased interest in Crypto and Zoomers increased interest in DogeCoin due to Elon Musk's tweets.</p>

      <p>Zoomers have become much more interested in the stock market in general whether it is publicly traded companies or Cryptocurrency. I believe that this stems from the fact that COVID has increased the interest of these Zoomers. Zoomers do not know how to focus and they are constantly being distracted by their phones and by the internet. COVID has made this even worse because now the Zoomers are only on their phones and computers and they have so much time on their hands to do whatever they want. So when they hear that they can make money by sitting at their desk staring at stock prices they immediately hop on the bandwagon.</p>
     
      <p>The second argument that I want to make for why DogeCoin has been going crazy is due to Zoomers interest in CryptoCurrency. One of the main things that we have discovered about Zoomers is that they have absolutely no attention span. Zoomers have never learned to pay attention and they never will because their lives are so full of distractions and that's all they have ever known. Crypto is the perfect thing for people like this because Crypto is so volatile. This means that one day the stock could be at $1 and the next day it could be at $55. Zoomers become addicted to this constant change and it gives them a reason to get out of bed every morning and that is to see how much money they made from Crypto.</p>
      
      <p>The final argument that I want to make about DogeCoin is that Zoomers see Elon Musk as a literal God. They retweet every single tweet that he puts on twitter and they listen to everything he says. Elon has made numerous tweets about sending DogeCoin to the moon and this has Zoomers going crazy. Elon Musk has heavily influenced the price of DogeCoin through his tweets and the main factor is that the Zoomers see this tweet and they instantly go steal their parents credit card to get their hands on some DogeCoin. I honestly hope that Elon Musk continues to tweet things like “DogeCoin to the moon” so that the Zoomers can make me rich.</p>
     
      <p>We have now concluded that the reason DogeCoin has gone so crazy in the past year is because of the Zoomers. We can all thank the Zoomers for making people rich and we can count on the Zoomers to send DogeCoin to the moon. We have realized that Zoomers are addicted to their phones and social media and have no attention span. We realized that all they can think about is their DogeCoin and when it will go up next. We have also realized that Elon is the leader of the Zoomers and that they will do anything that Elon says. All in all Zoomers are crypto addicts and we need them to get DogeCoin to the moon.</p>
