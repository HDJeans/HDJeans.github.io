	<h1> About me </h1>
</center>

<center>
	<p>My interest in information science began my freshman year of college after taking my first information science class. I learned that by pursuing this major I could use both my technical and social skills. I am a social person with a passion to understand other people’s needs. This gives me an advantage while working in groups because I am able to understand different types of people and use their skills to the advantage of the group. I also love data. Data can communicate and if it’s used correctly, it can really “talk” to people. After taking classes like "Data Science in the Real World" I learned the power of data. With my skill set I am able to take raw data and turn it into something meaningful for companies to use. When I need to show someone why a certain answer is correct, I will always turn to data and data visualizations. This type of skill set makes me unique because I can understand code while at the same time understand people’s needs. I hope to find a job where I can use these valuable skills.</p>
