<h1 id="txt_color"> Weekly Assignment 4 </h1>

<p class="classcolor">The bachelor is a tv show that has been around for many years and has been extremely popular. People love watching shows about love and romance and the bachelor takes love and romance to the next level. The first thing that I want to discuss about the bachelor is how old the contestants are in the show. The second thing that I want to discuss about the bachelor is the theory about one true love. The final thing I want to discuss about the bachelor is whether or not it is ethical. I will be using a dataset that I found on Github and three different sources that I found on the internet to back up my arguments.  </p>

<p id="txt_color">The first argument that I want to highlight is the age of the women on the show. After looking through my dataset and using excel to calculate the average age of the women on the show I found that the average age is 25. I think that this is the perfect age for people on the show because humans first start to fall in love around the age of 17. I found this out in my article from askwonder.com and found that people learn to love at 17. This is interesting because it is eight years before the average age of the female contestants on the bachelor. I believe that these eight years from 17 to 25 give these women a chance to find out what true love really is. It allows them time to fall in love and fall out of love. These are important things that need to happen for these women to learn what they are really getting themselves into when joining the show. This leads me into my next paragraph about if the one true love theory is true.</p>

<h1 id="txt_color"> Using excel I found that the average age of the bachelor contestants is 25.2 Years old </h1>

<p class="classcolor">There have been many arguments in the past that everyone has a soulmate. People believe that this soulmate is the only person that you can truly fall in love with and that you cannot actually fall in love with anyone else. If this was true it would be a major issue for the bachelor because what if the bachelors soulmate is not one of the female contestants. The good thing that I found out is that this is not true. In an article from psychologytoday.com I found that people have proven this theory wrong. People do not only have one soulmate and people can actually fall in love with whoever they want. I found that people define love for themselves and they can find their definition of love in many different ways. This is great for the context of the bachelor because the bachelor can find what he defines as love in any one of the women. This leads me into my final argument about whether or not the bachelor show is ethical.</p>

<p id="txt_color">I found a great article from mcgilltribune.com about whether or not the bachelor is ethical. One thing that this article really highlights is that this show is meant to be for people's entertainment. This show is actually a game show about which girl can take this man's heart first. I personally find this show unethical because it is playing with people's feelings. Love is such a strong emotion and people will go to extreme extents to capture someone's heart that they are in love with. If you turn this emotion into a game where women are doing whatever they can to fight over one person's heart then things can turn ugly. This is reflected in the show when we see all the drama that happens between these women. The worst part is that this drama is what the viewers love to see. These women are getting their hearts broken and put to tears just so that the viewers can get enjoyment and entertainment. Overall, the bachelor is an unethical show and I think that we need to think more about the emotional impact the show has on these women.
</p>

<p class="classcolor">In conclusion the bachelor is a popular show that is extremely entertaining for many people. One of the good sides that we found was that the age was very appropriate for what is going on in the show. We found that the average age of 25 is a great time for these women to fall in love. We also found that there is not only one true love in this world and that people can find love in many different ways. Last but not least we found that the bachelor is an unethical show. The show is messing with these Women's emotions for the viewers entertainment. All in all, this was a very interesting analysis and I hope to continue working with this dataset.</p>
