<h1 id="the_grass"> Weekly Assignment 4 </h1>

<p class="classcolor">The GameStop stock event was a pivotal moment in our economy that really exposed many weaknesses. We found that hedge funds and other organizations making billions off shorting can be extremely vulnerable. The internet has given the common people a special tool that allows them to shine in their own ways. When a group of people are frustrated with a policy or law then they usually take to the streets to protest. In this day and age, we have many other ways to protest through the internet. Through communication, freedom of trading and outright grit many money crazed individuals were able to shoot the GameStop stock through the roof. </p>

<p id="txt_color">The biggest factor that influenced this successful event was the ability for these people to communicate with each other. The internet gives people so much power because they are able to organize groups of people. This reminds of the hacker ethic and how the hacker ethic says to always share your data and information. By using the hacker ethic, the people on Reddit were able to share their information about these hedge funds that were massively shorting GameStop. After people found out about this they then decided as a collective to buy and hold as much of this stock as they can to take away money from the rich and wealthy.</p>

<p class="classcolor">China is a country where they monitor everything that there citizens do. China wants complete control because they are scared of people revolting against the government. In the US we are lucky because we have much more freedom. This gives us the ability to freely trade stocks and speak about whatever we want. With this type of power, we can do amazing things by working together. This is exactly how the GameStock event was successful was by working together. This reminds me of the GitHub community and the open source hacker mindset. If us programmers can continue to share information about things we learn on our own, then we can accomplish amazing things.</p>

<p id="txt_color">When you have an enemy that you cannot defeat then the smartest thing to do is join them instead of fight them. In the case of short trading many individuals donâ€™t like it for a variety of reasons, but they do it anyway because it is the best way to make money for them. In the case of the GameStop event people exposed these monopoly like hedge funds by doing exactly the opposite of short trading. This required a large amount of grit. The people buying these stocks had to risk putting in so much money but did it anyway because they had a common enemy. As an Information Scientist I want to always support events like this where I am helping the common person. I believe that the internet is the future and there is no better time to be an Information Scientist.</p>

<p class="classcolor">This economy changing event was really eye opening for many people. Many people have gained lots of knowledge including myself. I want to continue my role of being an Information Scientist by constantly sharing information that could benefit others just like these people did on Reddit. I also want to help this movement by using data from this event to create visuals that the common person can understand. I hope that we can continue to expose these wealthy hedge funds. WallStreetBets for life!</p>
