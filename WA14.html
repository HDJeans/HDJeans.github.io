<h1> Weekly Assignment 14 </h1>

<p>The first example that I want to discuss is going to be using Jupyter notebook. With my experience using Jupyter notebook I have had great experiences with creating easy to understand visualizations. I think that the perfect audience to present a Jupyter notebook to is a class of students. When you are a coding professor and you are trying to teach a large class of students how to understand a certain element in python then you need to show them examples and give them room to try on their own. I think that a Jupyter notebook is the perfect thing for this because you can use markdown to explain what you are doing in your code and you can also use the markdown features to explain what they need to do in their cells. This is something that I have experienced with teachers trying to teach me code and I have noticed it to be very effective.</p>

<p>The second example that I want to discuss is CSS and Bootstrap. These elements can be extremely effective in many different ways but the one that has stood out to me the most is for a personal portfolio. The audience that you are going to be presenting this to is any potential employer that you ever run into during your career. CSS allows for you to continuously better your website through many different features and it really is a never ending project that you can always improve on. Another element about CSS and Bootstrap that I think is so good for employers is that they can see that you were the one that coded this website. This is especially good if you are applying for technical roles and the recruiters can inspect your code and understand that you put a lot of work into your personal portfolio.</p>

<p>The final example that I want to discuss is using the amazing elements of RevealJS and Vega to your advantage in the workplace. If you are a data scientist and you are working for someone that needs you to give you the trends for car sales over the past 2 years then you need to be able to present this information in a professional manner. The best way that a data scientist can approach this problem is by using a RevealJS deck that incorporates visualizations using Vega. By using these amazing tools you will be able to present a beautiful slide deck that has great visualizations that clearly show the trends of car sales over the past 2 years. Another great thing about this type of slide deck is that whoever you are presenting to can go in and easily change the code if they want a different type of visualization.</p>
